    <!-- VB & JL: Using Ian Kuon's transistor sizing and drive strength data for routing, at 40 nm. Ian used BPTM 
			     models. We are modifying the delay values however, to include metal C and R, which allows more architecture
			     experimentation. We are also modifying the relative resistance of PMOS to be 1.8x that of NMOS
			     (vs. Ian's 3x) as 1.8x lines up with Jeff G's data from a 45 nm process (and is more typical of 
			     45 nm in general). I'm upping the Rmin_nmos from Ian's just over 6k to nearly 9k, and dropping 
			     RminW_pmos from 18k to 16k to hit this 1.8x ratio, while keeping the delays of buffers approximately
			     lined up with Stratix IV. 
			     We are using Jeff G.'s capacitance data for 45 nm (in tech/ptm_45nm).
			     Jeff's tables list C in for transistors with widths in multiples of the minimum feature size (45 nm).
			     The minimum contactable transistor is 2.5 * 45 nm, so I need to multiply drive strength sizes in this file
	                     by 2.5x when looking up in Jeff's tables.
			     The delay values are lined up with Stratix IV, which has an architecture similar to this
			     proposed FPGA, and which is also 40 nm 
			     C_ipin_cblock: input capacitance of a track buffer, which VPR assumes is a single-stage
			     4x minimum drive strength buffer. -->

	   Routing at W=300 is 30481 MWTAs, leaving us with a total of 53000 MWTAs for logic block area 
	   This means that only 37% of our area is in the general routing, and 63% is inside the logic
	   block. Note that the crossbar / local interconnect is considered part of the logic block
	   area in this analysis. That is a lower proportion of of routing area than most academics
	   assume, but note that the total routing area really includes the crossbar, which would push
	   routing area up significantly, we estimate into the ~70% range.

	  <!-- VB: the mux_trans_size and buf_size data below is in minimum width transistor *areas*, assuming the purple
	       book area formula. This means the mux transistors are about 5x minimum drive strength.
	       We assume the first stage of the buffer is 3x min drive strength to be reasonable given the large 
	       mux transistors, and this gives a reasonable stage ratio of a bit over 5x to the second stage. We assume
	       the n and p transistors in the first stage are equal-sized to lower the buffer trip point, since it's fed
	       by a pass transistor mux. We can then reverse engineer the buffer second stage to hit the specified 
	       buf_size (really buffer area) - 16.2x minimum drive nmos and 1.8*16.2 = 29.2x minimum drive.
	       I then took the data from Jeff G.'s PTM modeling of 45 nm to get the Cin (gate of first stage) and Cout 
	       (diff of second stage) listed below.  Jeff's models are in tech/ptm_45nm, and are in min feature multiples.
	       The minimum contactable transistor is 2.5 * 45 nm, so I need to multiply the drive strength sizes above by 
	       2.5x when looking up in Jeff's tables.
	       Finally, we choose a switch delay (58 ps) that leads to length 4 wires having a delay equal to that of SIV of 126 ps.
	       This also leads to the switch being 46% of the total wire delay, which is reasonable. -->
